            Hello everyone, I am Ojaswinee, a grade 10 student and this is my art portfolio. 
            I have been testing my artistic abilities since a young age. My first few sketches
             were in grade 3 which were off-looking drawings of Disney princesses. From there, I 
             started trying to draw more cartoon characters and and basic graphic art. Skip to 2 
             years later, I started to learn more about realism and colour theory. I started 
             working with paints, oil pastels, colour pencils, clay, and textures on canvas. 
             <br/>
             <br/>
             My understanding has gotten alot better from that of 5 years ago. I ,now, work mostly 
             with acryclic paints, 2 HB lead pencils, and I have my moments with air dry clay. I 
             have been working on my skills independently by following videos online, taking art 
             courses and attending clubs in school, looking up inspirations and tips, etc. Taking 
             up the big canvases was a huge step but also an important one. Knowing you can do a 
             good job at giving life to a canvas half your size gives you a feeling of 
             accomplishment. Of course, to get to canvases that are bigger than me and sketch 
             sketches with the purpose of being viewed by the public eye, I have a long way to go. 
             Therefore, I decided to kick start by resetting the purpose of these small sketches and 
             home projects to opening them up to the world. I hope you find my drawings interesting. 
             Enjoy!
